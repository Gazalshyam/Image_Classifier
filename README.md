In this project, I implemented an image classifier with PyTorch. A pre-trained VGG16 model was loaded, and its parameters were frozen. The parameters of the feedforward classifier were appropriately trained, while the parameters of the feature network were left static. This model allows users to choose from three different models. It is compatible for users without GPU.
